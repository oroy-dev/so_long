# so_long

My first little game developed in C using the MLX42 graphics library. The goal is to fetch all collectibles and get to the exit.

In this project, I learned to parse a set of characters and display them as images, make sure the different maps are feasible using a flood fill algorithm and learn to work with a new library.

To execute the project, make sure to add a map as argument like so: ./so_long map/<NAME_OF_MAP>.ber
